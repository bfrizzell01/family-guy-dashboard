# Holy Crap, a Family Guy Dashboard!

Family Guy is a very popular and successful TV Show, spanning 23 seasons and
over 430 episodes. This makes it very hard for fans to easily find their favourite 
episodes. This dashboard addresses this problem by allowing fans to find their
favourite episodes by filtering by season, ratings, and featured character
appearances. When the user selects their preferences, the table will show all
episodes that meet their criteria, with a brief synopsis. Freakin' sweet!
